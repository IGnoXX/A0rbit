# A0rbit

# Intro
This is a simple bot for DarkOrbit using the v4.1 client(or below) which is still in use by some private servers. I've created this bot for educational purpose to gain experience in the making process.

More features may come over time.

The [B0rbit](https://github.com/agrafix/B0rbit) repository helped me getting started, thanks for it!

# Setup
Provide the correct connection information in mod / clientInformation.py in order to get the bot running.
